abstract = {This paper presents a survey on automatic or semi-automatic recommendation systems that help users create dashboards. It starts by showing the important role that dashboards play in data science, and gives an informal definition of dashboards, i.e., a set of visualizations possibly with linkage, a screen layout and user feedback. We are mainly interested in systems that use a fully or partially automatic mechanism to recommend dashboards to users. This automation includes the suggestion of data and visualizations, the optimization of the layout and the use of user feedback. We position our work with respect to existing surveys. Starting from a set of over 1000 papers, we have selected and analyzed 19 papers/systems along several dimensions. The main dimensions were the set of considered visualizations, the suggestion method, the utility/objective functions, the layout, and the user interface. We conclude by highlighting the main achievements in this domain and by proposing perspectives.}

Hence, interest in dashboards has increased recently, which is also evident from the proliferation of dashboard solution providers in the market. Despite dashboards' popularity, little is known about the extent of their effectiveness, i.e. what types of dashboards work best for different users or tasks. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive multidisciplinary literature review with an aim to identify the critical issues organizations might need to consider when implementing dashboards. Dashboards are likely to succeed and solve the problems of presentation format and information load when certain visualization principles and features are present (e.g. high data-ink ratio and drill down features). We recommend that dashboards come with some level of flexibility, i.e. allowing users to switch between alternative presentation formats. Also some theory driven guidance through pop-ups and warnings can help users to select an appropriate presentation format. Given the dearth of research on dashboards, we conclude the paper with a research agenda that could guide future studies in this area.}

Dashboards can be used by governments to support their decision-making and policy processes or to communicate and interact with the public. The objective of this paper is to understand and to support the design of dashboards for creating transparency and accountability. Two smart city cases are investigated showing that dashboards can improve transparency and accountability, however, realizing these benefits was cumbersome and encountered various risks and challenges. Challenges include insufficient data quality, lack of understanding of data, poor analysis, wrong interpretation, confusion about the outcomes, and imposing a pre-defined view. These challenges can easily result in misconceptions, wrong decision-making, creating a blurred picture resulting in less transparency and accountability, and ultimately in even less trust in the government. Principles guiding the design of dashboards are presented. Dashboards need to be complemented by mechanisms supporting citizens' engagement, data interpretation, governance and institutional arrangements.}

abstract = {Objective
The consolidation of Telepharmacy during the COVID-19 pandemic has raised the need for managing large volumes of real-time activity data through data analysis. The aim of this project was to design a dynamic, user-friendly, customizable scorecard in a hospital pharmacy service for the visualization and analysis of Telepharmacy activity indicators through the use of advanced business intelligence technology.
Method
The software tool was developed by a multidisciplinary team between April and May 2021, driven from the hospital pharmacy service. Once the Telepharmacy indicators of interest were established, datasets were extracted from raw databases (administrative databases, Telepharmacy database, outpatient dispensing software, drug catalogues) through data analysis. The different data sources were integrated in a scorecard using PowerBI®. The criteria for processing missing and duplicated data were defined, and data pre-processing, normalization and transformation were performed. Once the pilot scorecard was validated by different profiles of users, the structure was designed for the panels to automatically update as databases were updated.
Results
Design and implementation of a scorecard of Telepharmacy activity: general descriptive panel (demographic profile of patients, count and delivery conditions, program and medical service); geolocation of destination; pharmacological profile; relative analysis of patients involved in the Telepharmacy program with respect to the total of outpatients. In the last updating as of January 2022, data from 16,000 dispensations to more than 4,000 patients had been collected. This means that 21.93% of outpatients had benefited at some time point from the Telepharmacy service. Filters enable the visualization of timeline progress and patient characterization, and measure Telepharmacy activity by program.
Conclusions
The processing of large Telemedicine datasets from various sources through Business Intelligence in a hospital pharmacy service makes it possible to synthesize information, generate customized reports, and visualize information in a dynamic and attractive format. The application of this new technology will help us improve strategic clinical and management decision making.
Resumen
Objetivo
La consolidación de la Telefarmacia en el contexto de la pandemia por la COVID-19 exige manejar a tiempo real un gran volumen de datos de actividad mediante análisis de datos. El objetivo de este trabajo fue diseñar un cuadro de mando ágil, personalizable y dinámico para la visualización y análisis de indicadores de actividad en Telefarmacia en un servicio de farmacia de hospital, mediante el empleo de herramientas avanzadas de inteligencia empresarial (business intelligence).
Método
Un equipo de trabajo multidisciplinar desarrolló una herramienta de software entre abril y mayo de 2021 impulsado desde el servicio de farmacia de hospital. Una vez consensuados los indicadores de interés en Telefarmacia, se extrajeron los datos a partir de bases de datos brutas (base de datos de Telefarmacia, programa de dispensación de pacientes externos, bases de datos administrativas, catálogos de fármacos) mediante análisis de datos. La integración de las diferentes fuentes de datos en el cuadro de mando se realizó mediante PowerBI®. Se definió el manejo de los datos perdidos y duplicados y se aplicó preprocesamiento, normalización y transformación de los datos. Una vez validado el piloto por diferentes tipos de usuarios, se diseñó la estructura para actualización automática de los paneles con las sucesivas actualizaciones de las fuentes de datos.
Resultados
Diseño e implementación de un cuadro de mando de la actividad en Telefarmacia: panel descriptivo general (perfil demográfico de pacientes, recuento y condiciones de envíos, programa y servicio médico); geolocalización de destino; perfil farmacológico; análisis relativo de los pacientes beneficiarios de Telefarmacia respecto del total de pacientes externos. En el último corte, a enero de 2022, se habían incluido datos de 16.000 dispensaciones con entrega informada a más de 4.000 pacientes, lo que supone que el 21,93% de los pacientes externos han estado en algún momento en el programa de Telefarmacia. La aplicación de filtros permite visualizar la evolución temporal, caracterizar grupos de pacientes y dimensionar la actividad por programas.
Conclusiones
El procesamiento de paquetes de datos de Telemedicina, de gran volumen, difícil manejo y procedentes de diversas fuentes relativas a Telefarmacia mediante inteligencia empresarial, en un servicio de farmacia de hospital, permite sintetizar la información y proporcionar informes personalizados y visualizaciones dinámicas y atractivas. La aplicación de estas nuevas tecnologías puede ayudarnos a mejorar la toma de decisiones estratégicas, tanto clínicas como de gestión.}

abstract = {Dashboards are popular tools for presenting key insights to decision-makers by translating large volumes of data into clear information. However, while individual visualizations may effectively answer specific questions, they often fail to connect in a way that conveys the overall narrative, leaving decision-makers without a cohesive understanding of the area under analysis. This paper presents a novel methodology for the systematic design of holistic dashboards, moving from analytical requirements to storytelling dashboards. Our approach ensures that all visualizations are aligned with the analytical goals of decision-makers. It includes several key steps: capturing analytical requirements through the i* framework; structuring and refining these requirements into a tree model to reflect the decision-maker’s mental analysis; identifying and preparing relevant data; capturing the key concepts and relationships for the composition of the cohesive storytelling dashboard through a novel storytelling conceptual model; finally, implementing and integrating the visualizations into the dashboard, ensuring coherence and alignment with the decision-maker’s needs. Our methodology has been applied in real-world industrial environments. We evaluated its impact through a controlled experiment. The findings show that storytelling dashboards significantly improve data interpretation, reduce misinterpretations, and enhance the overall user experience compared to traditional dashboards.}

abstract = {In recent years, new types of interactive analytical dashboard features have emerged for operational decision support systems (DSS). Analytical components of such features solve optimization problems hidden from the human eye, whereas interactive components involve the individual in the optimization process via graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Despite their expected value for organizations, little is known about the effectiveness of interactive analytical dashboards in operational DSS or their influences on human cognitive abilities. This paper contributes to the closing of this gap by exploring and empirically testing the effects of interactive analytical dashboard features on situation awareness (SA) and task performance in operational DSS. Using the theoretical lens of SA, we develop hypotheses about the effects of a what-if analysis as an interactive analytical dashboard feature on operational decision-makers' SA and task performance. The resulting research model is studied with a laboratory experiment, including eye-tracking data of 83 participants. Our findings show that although a what-if analysis leads to higher task performance, it may also reduce SA, nourishing a potential out-of-the-loop problem. Thus, designers and users of interactive analytical dashboards have to carefully mitigate these effects in the implementation and application of operational DSS. In this article, we translate our findings into implications for designing dashboards within operational DSS to help practitioners in their efforts to address the danger of the out-of-the-loop syndrome.}

An experiment was conducted in which undergraduate student participants were given a design activity and randomly assigned to one of five dashboards, each using the same underlying functions but varying in the visualization features employed. These features include different graphical representations of the design decision inputs and performance outputs. Participants were first asked to use their assigned dashboard to design a catapult system that maximizes launch distance while meeting requirements related to height, weight, and cost. Following the design task, they were asked a series of questions about their experiences with the dashboard and their understanding of the catapult model. A between-subjects analysis then evaluated how the dashboard design influenced various outcomes of interest. The results show that students who used the most feature-rich dashboard did not perform objectively better than those with the most feature-sparse dashboard, though their self-reported performance was higher. The performance of female versus male participants was also compared, with no significant differences found. The findings support the notion that dashboards should be designed with minimal features to convey the necessary information, and they also point out the disconnect between objective performance and user-assessed performance with interactive dashboards.}

However, the impact of information load of dashboards on cognitive load has rarely been investigated. The roles of user cognitive styles were also ignored. This study examined the effect of dashboard information load and user cognitive style on cognitive load when using dashboards in the construction industry. We designed a visual search experiment with five information load levels. Fifty-six participants, divided into field-dependent (FD) and field-independent (FI) groups, participated in the experiment. The results showed that the FI group had a lower cognitive load and was more efficient than the FD group. The effect of information load on cognitive load followed a piecewise linear correlation with the two prominent knots. The findings underscore the importance of assessing the information load and providing psychological underpinnings for cognitive-fit dashboard design for smart construction management.}

abstract = {Decision makers in organizations strive to improve the quality of their decisions. One way to improve that process is to objectify the decisions with facts. Data-driven Decision Support Systems (data-driven DSS), and more specifically business intelligence (BI) intend to achieve this. Organizations invest massively in the development of BI data-driven DSS and expect them to be adopted and to effectively support decision makers. This raises many technical and methodological challenges, especially regarding the design of BI dashboards, which can be seen as the visible tip of the BI data-driven DSS iceberg and which play a major role in the adoption of the entire system. In this paper, the dashboard content is investigated as one possible root cause for BI data-driven DSS dashboard adoption or rejection through an early empirical research. More precisely, this work is composed of three parts. In the first part, the concept of cognitive loads is studied in the context of BI dashboards and the informational, the representational and the non-informational loads are introduced. In the second part, the effects of these loads on the adoption of BI dashboards are then studied through an experiment with 167 respondents and a Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) analysis. The result is a Dashboard Adoption Model, enriching the seminal Technology Acceptance Model with new content-oriented variables to support the design of more supportive BI data-driven DSS dashboards. Finally, in the third part, a set of indicators is proposed to help dashboards designers in the monitoring of the loads of their dashboards practically.}
